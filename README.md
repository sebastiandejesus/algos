# Algos

## Introduction
Algos is a C and C++ library that contains common data structures and algorithms. If enabled,
data structures can utilize a synchronization mechanism (Mutual Exclusion) when thread synchronization
is desired. Algos is purely intended for personal use and not to be used in any commercial products.

## Task List
- [] Create additional data structures like HashMap, HashSet, Trees, Stack, Queue etc.
- [] Create additional algorithms like Binary Search, Quicksort, Mergesort etc.
- [] Update makefile to create a .so file.
- [] Update makefile for toggling synchronization.
- [] Add unit testing.
- [] Add license.
- [] Revisit synchronization mechanism used for thread safety.
